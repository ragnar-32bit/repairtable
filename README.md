Hello guys, you know that phpmyadminden table repair takes unnecessarily long, we have written a small script to eliminate this problem, an automatic table repair script, all you have to do is download the script and throw it to your website.

As you can see here, you will write your own server address instead of localhost, and in the same way, db_username and db_password will open this script by typing the username and password you use when entering your own server's database.
